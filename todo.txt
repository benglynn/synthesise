Glitch issue

1. Fade out and in or crossfade when waveform changes.

- Variable length of fade
- Equal power/linear algorithm
- Could deal with f, a or p changes
- Where do we maintain state?

2. Wait for a zero crossing point

- 0 or 0.5
- Then may need to set initial phase of new wave to 0.5. Phase reverse or polarity
- a would be okay, as we're crossing 0
- p is phase offset, affects both so okay
- where do we maintain state for initial phase?

- AudioNode as model
- Zero crossing, get rid of that nasty glitch!
- Break up js, add a MakeFile which also compresses for production
- square, sawtooth waveforms
- Display for freq, include note name
- Slider to add odd (square), or odd and even (sawtooth) harmonics
- Server side, respect get params
- Backbone routes for get params?
- Bootstrap?
