Glitch issue

- Oscillator
- AudioContext - master clock




- AudioNode as model
- Zero crossing, get rid of that nasty glitch!
- Break up js, add a MakeFile which also compresses for production
- square, sawtooth waveforms
- Display for freq, include note name
- Slider to add odd (square), or odd and even (sawtooth) harmonics
- Server side, respect get params
- Backbone routes for get params?
- Bootstrap?
